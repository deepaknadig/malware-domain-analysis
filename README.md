# Analyzing malicious URLs : A machine learning approach

The src folder includes all source code in jupyter notebook. For clusters result please refer to K-Means clustering.ipynb file. For silhoutte plot also please refer K-Means clustering.ipynb file.
For Elbow method plot please refer Elbow Method.ipynb. I tried to plot Elbow graph for different iteration. This file shows Elbow plot for 1000 iteration
For measuaring the frequency of malicious keywords please refer the jupyter notebook named Probabilistic model .ipynb. In this first I parse the new set of URLs, then make an array of clusters keywords. The last code is to claulate the frequency and its percentage.
In the result folder I have chart for each cluster's frequency.
