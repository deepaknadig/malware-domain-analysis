# Analyzing malicious URLs : A machine learning approach

The src folder includes all source code in jupyter notebook. For clusters result please refer to K-Means clustering.ipynb file. For silhouette plot also please refer K-Means clustering.ipynb file.
For Elbow method plot please refer Elbow Method.ipynb. I plot the Elbow graph for different iteration. This file shows the Elbow plot for 1000 iterationS. For measuring the frequency of malicious keywords in the testing set, please refer the jupyter notebook named Probabilistic model.ipynb. In this first, I parse the new set of URLs, then make an array of clusters keywords. The visualization folder contains visualization for clusters, result analysis plot, elbow plot and silhouette analysis plot. The System Design folders contain flow chart for this project, picture of the threat intelligence system and elasticsearch.
